Sending Music from one AVakai to another (or from smartphone).

The current version is Music-send-DEVICE_02 for sending Avakai, this one is also capable of connecting with Smartphone.
Music-send-HOST_02 is the receiving Avakai, it can not be coupled with Smartphone yet.



MusicTestApp is an Smartphone App to simulate the sending Avakai for debugging.
Music-send-DEVICE-for-app is meant to work with this app.
Those are only for debugging!
